•	The Notebook is used to predict median_house_value in California state,
•	I have used LinearRegression algorithm to impute the null values in total_bedrooms column
•	Used algorithm is RandomForestRegressor algorithm to predict the target value median_house_value  Output Rmse = 44550.4542
•	Used algorithm is RandomForest algorithm to predict the target value median_house_value
•	Predict the model using KNeighborsRegressor to predict the target value median_house_value  Output Rmse = 49216.184

   This Business case represented by hands_on_machine_learning book the trained model of the author get Rmse = 47415.1512
